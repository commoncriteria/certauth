    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">
      	Certification Authorities (CAs), and the infrastructure they support, form the basis for one of the primary
     	 mechanisms for providing strong assurance of identity in online transactions. The widely placed trust in
	CAs is at the heart of security mechanisms used to protect business and financial transactions online.
	Notably, protocols using Transport Layer Security (TLS) rely on certificates issued by CAs to identify and
	authenticate servers and clients in web transactions. Governments around the world rely on CAs to
	identify parties involved in transactions with them. <h:br/><h:br/>

	However, historical high-profile security breaches at major CAs trusted by widely used operating systems
	and browsers have highlighted both the critical role CAs play in securing electronic transactions, as well
	as the need to strongly protect them from malicious attacks. Analyses have revealed that these security
	breaches were often the result of insufficient security controls being in place on the computer systems
	and networks at these CAs, and were sometimes exacerbated by weak record keeping. Third-party
	auditing programs, whose role it was to verify that proper security controls were in place, were not
	sufficient to identify these lapses in security.<h:br/><h:br/>
	    
	This Protection Profile (PP) describing security requirements for a Certification Authority is intended to
	provide a minimal, baseline set of requirements that are targeted at mitigating well defined and described
	threats. These requirements support CA operations performed in accordance with the National Institute
	of Standards and Technologies (NIST) Interagency or Internal Report (IR) 7924 (Second Draft), Reference
	Certificate Policy, May 2014, referred to as the “NIST IR.” <h:br/><h:br/>

    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
	    A CA system is an entity that issues and manages public-key certificates. The CA is the primary component
	of a public key infrastructure (PKI), which consists of programs, data formats, procedures, communication
	protocols, security policies, and public key cryptographic mechanisms working together to enable people
	in various locations to establish trust through secure communications. To achieve this goal, a PKI may
	provide some or all of the following security management services:<h:br/>
	    <h:ul>
		    <h:li>Key generation/storage</h:li>
		    <h:li>Certificate generation, modification, re-key, renewal, and distribution</h:li>
		    <h:li>Certificate revocation list (CRL) generation and distribution</h:li>
		    <h:li>Key escrow and recovery</h:li>
		    <h:li>Directory management of certificate related items</h:li>
		    <h:li>Certificate token initialization/programming/management</h:li>
		    <h:li>System management functions (e.g., security audit, configuration management, archive)</h:li>
	    </h:ul>
	    A CA performs a number of certificate management functions besides certificate issuance:<h:br/>
	    <h:ul>
		    <h:li><h:b>Re-issuance:</h:b>A CA handles re-issuance of certificates when they expire, 
			    since certificates have a finite validity period. Reissuance may be renewal of the
			    current public key; rekey with a new public key; or modification to other data in 
			    the public key certificate.</h:li>
		    <h:li><h:b>Revocation:</h:b> The CA is also responsible for indicating, when notified 
			    via a subscriber or privileged user, that a certificate should no longer be used 
			    or relied upon; this is referred to as revocation. For example, a certificate 
			    needs to be revoked if an individuals’ private key is compromised or if the CA 
			    issued the certificate to the wrong person. Identifiers of revoked certificates
			    are stored on an electronic list called a certificate revocation list (CRL). The
			    CRL is digitally signed by the CA and published to a repository accessible by 
			    the relying parties. The CRL is used to compare against certificates to ensure a
			    certificate is not invalid when used. Alternatively, a CA can provide a 
			    Certificate Status Service (CSS) that provides revocation status responses to
			    subscribers and relying parties. The CSS’ revocation status information may be
			    based on certificate history information from the CA, a CRL from the CA, or a
			    CRL retrieved from a repository. A CA must be able to provide revocation status,
			    but either approach is acceptable. </h:li>
		    <h:li><h:b>Distribution:</h:b>The CA handles the publishing of certificates and CRLs
			    that it issues to a repository. The repository enables subscribers and relying
			    parties to obtain subscriber certificates and CRLs to perform functions such as 
			    encrypting emails and data to recipients or verifying signatures on transactions.
			    Typically, CRL location is advertised in the certificate itself as an HTTP pointer
			    to allow the relying parties to obtain the CRL.</h:li>
		    <h:li><h:b>Storage:</h:b> The CA keeps a history of a subscriber’s previously issued and
			    revoked certificates.</h:li>
	    </h:ul>
	There are a number of optional functions that a CA may perform. For example, a CA may issue CRLs 
	or may provide a CSS that responds to certificate status requests from subscribers and relying
	parties. A CA may generate public/private key pairs for subscribers, usually for encryption; this function may be
	delegated to a different PKI component. In some cases, a CA will escrow private keys for encryption 
	certificates, a function typically delegated to a key escrow PKI component. If a CA handles subscriber key
	generation and escrow, it should also keep a history of subscriber keys to support cases where an old
	encryption key may be required to decrypt data. A CA may also be responsible for verifying subscriber
	identities who request to interact with the CA. If the CA does not provide this functionality directly, it is
	expected to interface with a registration authority (RA) that does.<h:br/><h:br/>

	The CA can be internal to an organization or it can be managed by an outside organization dedicated to
	this type of service. If the CA is internal, the organization controls the CA server, configures how the
	subscriber identity proofing takes place during registration, maintains the certificates, and revokes
	certificates when necessary. If the CA is a third party organization specifically designed to serve as a CA,
	then other individuals and companies pay them to supply this service. Depending on the nature of
	agreement and service, the organization may be fully or to some extent involved in subscriber registration,
	certificate management, and revocation.	    
	    
      <subsection title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">
	Figure 1 below illustrates an example PKI architecture; this architecture is for illustration only and is not
	meant to represent requirements for an actual deployment. Within a PKI, the CA is responsible for issuing
	and managing public-key certificates for subjects to prove their identities; these subjects are typically
	called subscribers and can be people, devices, applications, or servers. A public-key certificate is a
	credential that contains the public key for that subscriber bound with other identifying information using
	a CA’s digital signature. To obtain a certificate, subscribers register with the PKI. Depending on how the
	PKI is designed, this is done either directly through the CA itself or optionally through a third-party RA
	which verifies the requester’s identity before the request is handled by the CA. Part of the registration
	process is the generation of a private/public key pair that occurs either at the CA, at the RA or (typically)
	on the subscriber’s system. If not generated by the CA, the public key is transmitted to the CA during the
	registration process. The CA signs the certificate with a digital signature (using its own private key) that
	binds the public key and other identifying information to the subscriber. In this capacity, the CA acts as a
	trusted third party by asserting the authenticity of the subscriber, the public key, and the binding of the
	subscriber to the public key. This allows relying parties (e.g., individuals or applications) to verify and trust
	signatures or assertions made by the subscriber using the private key that corresponds to the public key
	contained in the certificate. This also allows the relying parties to use the public key in the certificate to
	carry out encrypted communication with the subscriber.<h:br/><h:br/>
	      
	<figure entity="images/CertAuth-Toe.png" title="TOE Boundary in Example PKI Architecture" id="toe"/>
	      
	This PP defines requirements only for CA system component(s) that issue and manage public key
	certificates and certificate status information, to include interfaces to components not under the control
	of the ST author that may be required to meet these requirements as shown in Figure 1. <h:br/><h:br/>
	      
	While the functionality that the TOE is obligated to implement (in response to the described threat
	environment) is discussed in detail in later sections, it is useful to give a brief description here. Compliant
	TOEs will provide security functionality that addresses threats to the TOE and implements policies that
	are imposed by law or regulation. Compliant TOEs must authenticate and validate certificate requests and
	control the use of its private signature key(s) so that only valid, properly authorized certificates are issued;
	it must validate and authenticate all revocation requests and provide accurate and up-to-date revocation
	status information; and it must validate any requests for optional services (key generation, key escrow or
	recovery), authenticate and determine authorization for such services according to applicable security
	policies and ensure that only authorized services are performed. The TOE must protect itself from
	common network attacks, limit the damage that could occur by privileged user error, and be able to
	recover from damage that can occur via either network attacks or human error, to include reconstitution
	of functionality necessary to maintain any and all certificates issued for the duration of their validity
	periods in the case of TOE failure. The TOE must also offer auditing of a set of events that are associated
	with security-relevant activity on the TOE, and these events must be retained for long-term storage even
	in the event of a failure of the TOE. Audit storage should be reliable and extensible, although this could
	be on a device that is distinct from the TOE. The TOE must offer some protection for common network
	denial of service attacks and must also provide the ability to verify the source of updates to components
	of the TOE. <h:br/><h:br/>
	      
	A CA system which is the Target of Evaluation (TOE) of this PP may be a software package installed on a
	general computing platform, a set of software packages installed on distributed general computing
	platforms, or an integrated device including hardware and software. This PP makes no distinction in these
	cases and imposes requirements on the TOE and/or Operational Environment to ensure that the
	requirements can be met in any of these cases. Whenever the TOE depends on external components to
	meet the requirements of this PP, those components are included in the Operational Environment and
	the AGD_OPE and AGD_PRE sections of this PP describe requirements on the TOE to document these
	dependencies. For example, the TOE provides cryptographic operations involved in the signing of
	certificates, which may depend on an external cryptographic module such as a trusted computing module
	(TPM) on the general computing platform or an external hardware security module (HSM).<h:br/><h:br/>

	The CA manages certificates by providing validity information, either via the issuance of Certificate
	Revocation Lists (CRLs) or via a Certificate Status Service (CSS) that provides real-time responses to validity
	queries. Because a CA acts as a trusted third party, and because recommended operations require
	independent monitoring of its operations, the CA must maintain an audit record that can be reviewed.
	This audit record may be maintained on the TOE, or on an external audit server.<h:br/><h:br/>
	
	The threats and security objectives apply generally to a CA system. In order to provide consistent
	requirements for all TOEs, the requirements in Section 5 include selections to indicate where external
	components may be used. The TOE platform, external cryptographic modules, external audit servers, and
	external CSS that are not under the control of the security target (ST) author may be used to meet the
	respective TOE requirements. In these cases, the ST author must provide evidence that the requirement
	is met by the selected component. When external components are selected, this evidence is typically via
	validation against an appropriate PP.<h:br/><h:br/>
	      
	It is intended that the set of requirements in this PP is limited in scope in order to promote quicker, less
	costly evaluations that provide some value to end users.

    <section title="Use Cases" id="usecases">
	Requirements in this PP are designed to address the security problem for CA systems. The fundamental
	usage of a CA system will not differ drastically based on the functionality it provides. Different TOEs may
	vary because of the inclusion or exclusion of the various optional, objective, and selection-based

Generally, this is only once at <abbr linkend="VM"/> startup. However, some devices can be connected and disconnected during operation (e.g., virtual USB devices such as CD-ROMs). All such connection/disconnection events must be logged.

      The Security Objectives in 
      <secref linkend="obj"/> were constructed to address threats identified in
      <secref linkend="threats"/>. The Security Functional Requirements (<abbr linkend="SFR"/>s)
      in <secref linkend="SFRs"/> are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP
      identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (<abbr linkend="SAR"/>s) to frame the extent to
      which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs
      independent testing. <h:br/> This section lists the set of <abbr linkend="SAR"/>s from CC part 3
      that are required in evaluations against this PP. Individual Assurance Activities
      <!--(AAs). Never use these again --> to be performed are specified both in <secref
        linkend="req"/> as well as in this section. <h:br/> The general model for evaluation of <abbr
        linkend="OS"/>s against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows: <h:br/> After the
        <abbr linkend="ST"/> has been approved for evaluation, the <abbr class="expanded"
        title="Information Technology Security Evaluation Facility">ITSEF</abbr> will obtain the
        <abbr linkend="OS"/>, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for
      the OS. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation
      Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Assurance Activities
      contained within <secref linkend="req"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the
      other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the
      OS. The Assurance Activities that are captured in <secref linkend="req"/> also provide
      clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the OS is compliant
      with the PP. <subsection title="Class ASE: Security Target" id="ase">As per ASE activities
        defined in <cite linkend="bibCEM"/>.</subsection>
      <subsection title="Class ADV: Development" id="adv">The information about the <abbr
          linkend="OS"/> is contained in the guidance documentation available to the end user as
        well as the <abbr linkend="TSS"/> portion of the <abbr linkend="ST"/>. The <abbr
          linkend="OS"/> developer must concur with the description of the product that is
        contained in the TSS as it relates to the functional requirements. The Assurance Activities
        contained in <secref linkend="SFRs"/> should provide the <abbr linkend="ST"/> authors with
        sufficient information to determine the appropriate content for the TSS section.

          the Operational Environment that are not directly invokable by <abbr linkend="OS"/>
          users, there is little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of
          themselves since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible. For this PP,
          the activities for this family should focus on understanding the interfaces presented in
          the <abbr linkend="TSS"/> in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces
          presented in the AGD documentation. No additional “functional specification” documentation
          is necessary to satisfy the assurance activities specified. The interfaces that need to be
          evaluated are characterized through the information needed to perform the assurance
          activities listed, rather than as an independent, abstract list.

              <aactivity>The evaluator will prepare a test plan and report documenting the testing
              aspects of the system, including any application crashes during testing. The evaluator
              shall determine the root cause of any application crashes and include that information
              in the report. The test plan covers all of the testing actions contained in the <cite
                linkend="bibCEM"/> and the body of this PP’s Assurance Activities. <h:br/> While it is
              not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an Assurance Activity, the
              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
              the <abbr linkend="ST"/> is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be
              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the
                <abbr linkend="ST"/>, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the
              platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
              platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
              affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
              differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
              the <abbr linkend="ST"/> are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
              describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
              necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
              the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
              of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
              may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
              just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely
              affect the performance of the functionality by the <abbr linkend="OS"/> and its
              platform. <h:br/> This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be
              used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
              this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS). The test
              plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be
              followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. <h:br/>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
              test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
              the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the supporting
              details), and not just the “pass” result.</aactivity>

  <!-- Remove this section if an Entropy Assessment is not needed -->
  <appendix title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment" id="entropyappendix"> This appendix
    describes the required supplementary information for the entropy source used by the OS. <h:br/>
    The documentation of the entropy source should be detailed enough that, after reading, the
    evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why it can be relied upon to provide
    sufficient entropy. This documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design
    description, entropy justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation
    is not required to be part of the TSS. <section id="entropydesign" title="Design Description">
      Documentation shall include the design of the entropy source as a whole, including the
      interaction of all entropy source components. Any information that can be shared regarding the
      design should also be included for any third-party entropy sources that are included in the
      product. <h:br/> The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to include,
      how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the
      entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source
      design indicating where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any
      post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how
      it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking)
      should also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.
      <h:br/> This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of
      the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary
      outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate. <h:br/> If implemented, the design
      description shall include a description of how third-party applications can add entropy to the
      RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on shall be included. </section>
    <section id="entropyjustification" title="Entropy Justification"> There should be a technical
      argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence
      in the entropy source delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output (by
      this particular OS). This argument will include a description of the expected min-entropy
      rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per bit or byte of source data) and explain that
      sufficient entropy is going into the OS randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be
      part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to produce bits with
      entropy. <h:br/> The amount of information necessary to justify the expected min-entropy rate
      depends on the type of entropy source included in the product. <h:br/> For developer provided
      entropy sources, in order to justify the min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number
      of raw source bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the min-entropy
      rate determined from the statistical tests. While no particular statistical tests are required
      at this time, it is expected that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount
      of min-entropy in each output. <h:br/> For third-party provided entropy sources, in which the
      OS vendor has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the
      documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy obtained from this
      third-party source. It is acceptable for the vendor to “assume” an amount of min-entropy,
      however, this assumption must be clearly stated in the documentation provided. In particular,
      the min-entropy estimate must be specified and the assumption included in the ST. <h:br/>
      Regardless of type of entropy source, the justification will also include how the DRBG is
      initialized with the entropy stated in the ST, for example by verifying that the min-entropy
      rate is multiplied by the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the rate of
      entropy expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and compared to the
      statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG is not clear or the
      calculated rate is not explicitly related to the seed, the documentation will not be
      considered complete. <h:br/> The entropy justification shall not include any data added from any
      third-party application or from any state saving between restarts. </section>
    <section id="entropyoperatingconditions" title="Operating Conditions"> The entropy rate may be
      affected by conditions outside the control of the entropy source itself. For example, voltage,
      frequency, temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the factors that may
      affect the operation of the entropy source. As such, documentation will also include the range
      of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. It
      will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the system design to ensure the
      entropy source continues to operate under those conditions. Similarly, documentation shall
      describe the conditions under which the entropy source is known to malfunction or become
      inconsistent. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of the source shall be included. </section>
    <section id="entropyhealthtesting" title="Health Testing"> More specifically, all entropy source
      health tests and their rationale will be documented. This includes a description of the health
      tests, the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at start,
      continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, and rationale
      indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in
      the entropy source. </section>
