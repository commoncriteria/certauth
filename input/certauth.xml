  <chapter title="Introduction" id="int">
    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">
      	Certification Authorities (CAs), and the infrastructure they support, form the basis for one of the primary
     	 mechanisms for providing strong assurance of identity in online transactions. The widely placed trust in
	CAs is at the heart of security mechanisms used to protect business and financial transactions online.
	Notably, protocols using Transport Layer Security (TLS) rely on certificates issued by CAs to identify and
	authenticate servers and clients in web transactions. Governments around the world rely on CAs to
	identify parties involved in transactions with them. <h:br/><h:br/>

	However, historical high-profile security breaches at major CAs trusted by widely used operating systems
	and browsers have highlighted both the critical role CAs play in securing electronic transactions, as well
	as the need to strongly protect them from malicious attacks. Analyses have revealed that these security
	breaches were often the result of insufficient security controls being in place on the computer systems
	and networks at these CAs, and were sometimes exacerbated by weak record keeping. Third-party
	auditing programs, whose role it was to verify that proper security controls were in place, were not
	sufficient to identify these lapses in security.<h:br/><h:br/>
	    
	This Protection Profile (PP) describing security requirements for a Certification Authority is intended to
	provide a minimal, baseline set of requirements that are targeted at mitigating well defined and described
	threats. These requirements support CA operations performed in accordance with the National Institute
	of Standards and Technologies (NIST) Interagency or Internal Report (IR) 7924 (Second Draft), Reference
	Certificate Policy, May 2014, referred to as the “NIST IR.” <h:br/><h:br/>

    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
	    A CA system is an entity that issues and manages public-key certificates. The CA is the primary component
	of a public key infrastructure (PKI), which consists of programs, data formats, procedures, communication
	protocols, security policies, and public key cryptographic mechanisms working together to enable people
	in various locations to establish trust through secure communications. To achieve this goal, a PKI may
	provide some or all of the following security management services:<h:br/>
	    <h:ul>
		    <h:li>Key generation/storage</h:li>
		    <h:li>Certificate generation, modification, re-key, renewal, and distribution</h:li>
		    <h:li>Certificate revocation list (CRL) generation and distribution</h:li>
		    <h:li>Key escrow and recovery</h:li>
		    <h:li>Directory management of certificate related items</h:li>
		    <h:li>Certificate token initialization/programming/management</h:li>
		    <h:li>System management functions (e.g., security audit, configuration management, archive)</h:li>
	    </h:ul>
	    A CA performs a number of certificate management functions besides certificate issuance:<h:br/>
	    <h:ul>
		    <h:li><h:b>Re-issuance:</h:b>A CA handles re-issuance of certificates when they expire, 
			    since certificates have a finite validity period. Reissuance may be renewal of the
			    current public key; rekey with a new public key; or modification to other data in 
			    the public key certificate.</h:li>
		    <h:li><h:b>Revocation:</h:b> The CA is also responsible for indicating, when notified 
			    via a subscriber or privileged user, that a certificate should no longer be used 
			    or relied upon; this is referred to as revocation. For example, a certificate 
			    needs to be revoked if an individuals’ private key is compromised or if the CA 
			    issued the certificate to the wrong person. Identifiers of revoked certificates
			    are stored on an electronic list called a certificate revocation list (CRL). The
			    CRL is digitally signed by the CA and published to a repository accessible by 
			    the relying parties. The CRL is used to compare against certificates to ensure a
			    certificate is not invalid when used. Alternatively, a CA can provide a 
			    Certificate Status Service (CSS) that provides revocation status responses to
			    subscribers and relying parties. The CSS’ revocation status information may be
			    based on certificate history information from the CA, a CRL from the CA, or a
			    CRL retrieved from a repository. A CA must be able to provide revocation status,
			    but either approach is acceptable. </h:li>
		    <h:li><h:b>Distribution:</h:b>The CA handles the publishing of certificates and CRLs
			    that it issues to a repository. The repository enables subscribers and relying
			    parties to obtain subscriber certificates and CRLs to perform functions such as 
			    encrypting emails and data to recipients or verifying signatures on transactions.
			    Typically, CRL location is advertised in the certificate itself as an HTTP pointer
			    to allow the relying parties to obtain the CRL.</h:li>
		    <h:li><h:b>Storage:</h:b> The CA keeps a history of a subscriber’s previously issued and
			    revoked certificates.</h:li>
	    </h:ul>
	There are a number of optional functions that a CA may perform. For example, a CA may issue CRLs 
	or may provide a CSS that responds to certificate status requests from subscribers and relying
	parties. A CA may generate public/private key pairs for subscribers, usually for encryption; this function may be
	delegated to a different PKI component. In some cases, a CA will escrow private keys for encryption 
	certificates, a function typically delegated to a key escrow PKI component. If a CA handles subscriber key
	generation and escrow, it should also keep a history of subscriber keys to support cases where an old
	encryption key may be required to decrypt data. A CA may also be responsible for verifying subscriber
	identities who request to interact with the CA. If the CA does not provide this functionality directly, it is
	expected to interface with a registration authority (RA) that does.<h:br/><h:br/>

	The CA can be internal to an organization or it can be managed by an outside organization dedicated to
	this type of service. If the CA is internal, the organization controls the CA server, configures how the
	subscriber identity proofing takes place during registration, maintains the certificates, and revokes
	certificates when necessary. If the CA is a third party organization specifically designed to serve as a CA,
	then other individuals and companies pay them to supply this service. Depending on the nature of
	agreement and service, the organization may be fully or to some extent involved in subscriber registration,
	certificate management, and revocation.	    
	    
      <subsection title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">
	Figure 1 below illustrates an example PKI architecture; this architecture is for illustration only and is not
	meant to represent requirements for an actual deployment. Within a PKI, the CA is responsible for issuing
	and managing public-key certificates for subjects to prove their identities; these subjects are typically
	called subscribers and can be people, devices, applications, or servers. A public-key certificate is a
	credential that contains the public key for that subscriber bound with other identifying information using
	a CA’s digital signature. To obtain a certificate, subscribers register with the PKI. Depending on how the
	PKI is designed, this is done either directly through the CA itself or optionally through a third-party RA
	which verifies the requester’s identity before the request is handled by the CA. Part of the registration
	process is the generation of a private/public key pair that occurs either at the CA, at the RA or (typically)
	on the subscriber’s system. If not generated by the CA, the public key is transmitted to the CA during the
	registration process. The CA signs the certificate with a digital signature (using its own private key) that
	binds the public key and other identifying information to the subscriber. In this capacity, the CA acts as a
	trusted third party by asserting the authenticity of the subscriber, the public key, and the binding of the
	subscriber to the public key. This allows relying parties (e.g., individuals or applications) to verify and trust
	signatures or assertions made by the subscriber using the private key that corresponds to the public key
	contained in the certificate. This also allows the relying parties to use the public key in the certificate to
	carry out encrypted communication with the subscriber.<h:br/><h:br/>
	      
	<figure entity="images/CertAuth-TOE.png" title="TOE Boundary in Example PKI Architecture" id="toe"/>
	      
	<h:br/><h:br/>This PP defines requirements only for CA system component(s) that issue and manage public key
	certificates and certificate status information, to include interfaces to components not under the control
	of the ST author that may be required to meet these requirements as shown in Figure 1. <h:br/><h:br/>
	      
	While the functionality that the TOE is obligated to implement (in response to the described threat
	environment) is discussed in detail in later sections, it is useful to give a brief description here. Compliant
	TOEs will provide security functionality that addresses threats to the TOE and implements policies that
	are imposed by law or regulation. Compliant TOEs must authenticate and validate certificate requests and
	control the use of its private signature key(s) so that only valid, properly authorized certificates are issued;
	it must validate and authenticate all revocation requests and provide accurate and up-to-date revocation
	status information; and it must validate any requests for optional services (key generation, key escrow or
	recovery), authenticate and determine authorization for such services according to applicable security
	policies and ensure that only authorized services are performed. The TOE must protect itself from
	common network attacks, limit the damage that could occur by privileged user error, and be able to
	recover from damage that can occur via either network attacks or human error, to include reconstitution
	of functionality necessary to maintain any and all certificates issued for the duration of their validity
	periods in the case of TOE failure. The TOE must also offer auditing of a set of events that are associated
	with security-relevant activity on the TOE, and these events must be retained for long-term storage even
	in the event of a failure of the TOE. Audit storage should be reliable and extensible, although this could
	be on a device that is distinct from the TOE. The TOE must offer some protection for common network
	denial of service attacks and must also provide the ability to verify the source of updates to components
	of the TOE. <h:br/><h:br/>
	      
	A CA system which is the Target of Evaluation (TOE) of this PP may be a software package installed on a
	general computing platform, a set of software packages installed on distributed general computing
	platforms, or an integrated device including hardware and software. This PP makes no distinction in these
	cases and imposes requirements on the TOE and/or Operational Environment to ensure that the
	requirements can be met in any of these cases. Whenever the TOE depends on external components to
	meet the requirements of this PP, those components are included in the Operational Environment and
	the AGD_OPE and AGD_PRE sections of this PP describe requirements on the TOE to document these
	dependencies. For example, the TOE provides cryptographic operations involved in the signing of
	certificates, which may depend on an external cryptographic module such as a trusted computing module
	(TPM) on the general computing platform or an external hardware security module (HSM).<h:br/><h:br/>

	The CA manages certificates by providing validity information, either via the issuance of Certificate
	Revocation Lists (CRLs) or via a Certificate Status Service (CSS) that provides real-time responses to validity
	queries. Because a CA acts as a trusted third party, and because recommended operations require
	independent monitoring of its operations, the CA must maintain an audit record that can be reviewed.
	This audit record may be maintained on the TOE, or on an external audit server.<h:br/><h:br/>
	
	The threats and security objectives apply generally to a CA system. In order to provide consistent
	requirements for all TOEs, the requirements in Section 5 include selections to indicate where external
	components may be used. The TOE platform, external cryptographic modules, external audit servers, and
	external CSS that are not under the control of the security target (ST) author may be used to meet the
	respective TOE requirements. In these cases, the ST author must provide evidence that the requirement
	is met by the selected component. When external components are selected, this evidence is typically via
	validation against an appropriate PP.<h:br/><h:br/>
	      
	It is intended that the set of requirements in this PP is limited in scope in order to promote quicker, less
	costly evaluations that provide some value to end users.

    <section title="Use Cases" id="usecases">
	Requirements in this PP are designed to address the security problem for CA systems. The fundamental
	usage of a CA system will not differ drastically based on the functionality it provides. Different TOEs may

	    The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) included in this section are derived from Part 2 of the
	Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Version 3.1, Revision 4, with
	additional extended functional components. The following table lists the SFRs that are defined in this
	section as well as any auditable events associated with their enforcement. The following table presents
	the baseline (mandatory) requirements for compliant TOEs, and also used to specify whether the TSF or
	OE is responsible for actions pertaining to a particular audit event associated with the SFRs (this is done
	in FAU_ADP_EXT.1 below). If the TOE relies on the Operational Environment to provide some of the
	TOE’s auditing functionality, the ST author is expected to identify whether each of the auditable events
	for the claimed SFRs are implemented by the TSF or by the Operational Environment, along with the
	specific environmental component that provides the auditing functionality if applicable. The ST author
	should refer to the right-most column of Table 4 through Table 6 and complete these fields accordingly.<h:br/><h:br/>

	<!-- The CA audit table actually has 5 fields, but the fifth one is not used.
	     The fourth field reports the retention requirement for the records. This seems like it should not be

            <note role="application">
		  If any audit functions (e.g. storage, review) are accomplished by the TOE
		communicating over a network connection with a physically external audit server,
		then the ST author must include FTP_ITC.1 with "audit server" selected. If the TOE
		relies on the Operational Environment to provide some of the TOE’s auditing
		functionality, the ST author is expected to identify whether each of the auditable
		events for the claimed SFRs are implemented by the TOE or by the Operational
		Environment, along with the specific environmental component that provides the
		auditing functionality if applicable. The ST author should refer to the right-most
		column of Table 4 through Table 6 and complete these fields accordingly<h:br/><h:br/>
		    
		   If any audit review is performed by an auditor through an interface provided by
		the TSF, then FAU_SAR.1 and FAU_SAR.3 in Annex B.2 will be included in the ST by
		the ST author.<h:br/><h:br/>

		If any audit pre-selection is performed by an auditor through an interface provided
		by the TSF, then FAU_SEL.1 in Annex B.2 will be included in the ST by the ST author.<h:br/><h:br/>
		    
		Audit records stored within the TOE boundary that are generated due to audit
		events marked “extended” in tables 4, 5, and 6 that are included in the ST, then
		FAU_STG.1(2) will be included in the ST by the ST author.<h:br/><h:br/>   

		If the TSF initiates the storage of the audit data (that is, it generates audit data
		that will be stored either by the TOE or the OE), then FAU_STG_EXT.1 will be
		included in the ST by the ST Author. <h:br/><h:br/>
		    
		Audit records for the TSF are divided into two sets of events, whose retention
		periods might be significantly different operationally. Generally, information
		necessary to maintain an issued certificate or to determine the circumstances of
		a certificate issuance is required to be available at least as long as the validity of
		an issued certificate, and perhaps longer according the statutes, laws, or policies
		applicable to the issuance and intended use of a particular certificate. Other audit
		data is typically retained only to support normal operations. The ‘Retention’
		column in Table 4 (as well as Tables 5 and 6 for the optional and selection-based
		SFRs) indicates whether the audit record is intended to be used for ‘normal’
		(shorter-term) or ‘extended’ (longer-term) purposes.<h:br/><h:br/>
   
		For the FDP_CER_EXT.2 audit event, the intent is that auditing is performed only
		once incoming data are recognized by the TOE as a “request”. Cases where
		incoming data are rejected before they are processed as “requests” by the TOE
		(and thus the action “fails”) do not need to be audited by the FDP_CER_EXT.2
		audit event.<h:br/><h:br/>

			proper entries and that the audit records are provided in a manner suitable for
			interpretation. The evaluator shall also ensure the ability to apply searches of

			Environment is selected in FAU_GEN.1.1 or FAU_GEN.1.2, the evaluator shall
			follow the operational guidance to configure the Operational Environment as

			Note that the testing here can be accomplished in conjunction with the testing

				FDP_CER_EXT.1.2 is intended to clarify the standard interpretation that subject

				that the public keys are unique). The intended meaning is that it is acceptable to
				issue a certificate with a public key contained in a request that happens to match 
				another certificate issued by the CA when the other certificate also contains the
				requested public key; it is not acceptable that requests for certificates containing
				different public keys result in the same subject key identifier - as this would
				contradict the definition of the subject key identifier included in the RFC: "The
				subject key identifier extension provides a means of identifying certificates that
				contain a particular public key." This is not possible if the value is not unique to
				the public keys it issues. <h:br/><h:br/>
				The SFR refines RFC 5280 by requiring all certificate profiles used by the TOE be
				configurable to include the subject key identifier; the RFC only requires it for CA
				certificates. The RFC indicates a CA SHOULD provide subject key identifiers for end
				entity certificates.<h:br/><h:br/>
				When a single instance of the TOE represents multiple CAs, it is acceptable that a
				subject key identifier issued by one CA match the subject key identifier of another
				CA, whether implemented within the TOE or as a separate instance.

						<h:b>Field “d”:</h:b> The evaluator shall send a request with a

    <section title="Security Assurance Requirements" id="SARs">

	The Security Objectives for the TOE in Section 4 were constructed to address threats identified in Section
	3. The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) in Section 5.1 are a formal instantiation of the Security
	Objectives. The PP draws from the CC Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to
	which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs independent
	testing.<h:br/><h:br/>
	While this section contains the complete set of SARs from the CC, the Assurance Activities to be performed
	by an evaluator are detailed both in Section 5.1 as well as in this section.<h:br/><h:br/>
	The general model for evaluating TOEs against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows:<h:br/><h:br/>
	After the ST has been approved for evaluation, the Common Criteria Testing Laboratory (CCTL) will obtain
	the TOE, supporting IT environment, and the administrative guides for the TOE. The Assurance Activities
	listed in the ST (which will be refined by the CCTL to be TOE-specific, either within the ST or in a separate
	document) will then be performed by the CCTL. The results of these activities will be documented and
	presented (along with the administrative guidance used) for validation.<h:br/><h:br/>
	For each assurance family, “Developer Notes” are provided on the developer action elements to clarify
	what, if any, additional documentation/activity needs to be provided by the developer. For the
	content/presentation and evaluator activity elements, additional assurance activities are described as a
	whole for the family, rather than for each element. Additionally, the assurance activities described in this
	section are complementary to those specified in Section 5.1.<h:br/><h:br/>
	The TOE security assurance requirements defined in this section identify the management and evaluative
	activities required to address the threats identified in Section 3.1 of this PP.<h:br/><h:br/>

				evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing
				requirement in the ST is covered.<h:br/><h:br/>
				The test plan identifies the platforms to be tested, and for those platforms not
				included in the test plan but included in the ST, the test plan provides a
				justification for not testing the platforms. This justification must address the
				differences between the tested platforms and the untested platforms, and
				make an argument that the differences do not affect the testing to be

				affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in the ST are tested,
				then no rationale is necessary.<h:br/><h:br/>
				The test plan describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any
				setup that is necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation.
				It should be noted that the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD
				documentation for installation and setup of each platform either as part of a
				test or as a standard pre-test condition. This may include special test drivers or
				tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not just an assertion) should be
				provided that the driver or tool will not adversely affect the performance of
				the functionality by the TOE and its platform. This also includes the
				configuration of the cryptographic engine to be used. The cryptographic
				algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by this PP and used
				by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS/HTTPS, SSH).<h:br/><h:br/>
				The test plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures
				to be followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected
				results. The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test
				plan) details the activities that took place when the test procedures were
				executed, and includes the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative
				account, so if there was a test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and
				then a successful re-run of the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass”
				result (and the supporting details), and not just the “pass” result.

				either provides a rationale with respect to its non-applicability, or the evaluator
				formulates a test (using the guidelines provided in ATE_IND) to confirm the
				vulnerability, if suitable. Suitability is determined by assessing the attack vector
				needed to take advantage of the vulnerability. For example, if the vulnerability
				can be detected by pressing a key combination on boot-up, a test would be
				suitable at the assurance level of this PP. If exploiting the vulnerability requires 
				expert skills and an electron microscope, for instance, then a test would not be
				suitable and an appropriate justification would be formulated.

                specifications in the Recommendation. These components include the calculation of
                the DLC primitives (the shared secret value Z) and the calculation of the derived
                keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation Function (KDF). If key confirmation is
                supported, the evaluator shall also verify that the components of key confirmation
                have been implemented correctly, using the test procedures described below. This
                includes the parsing of the DKM, the generation of MACdata and the calculation of
                MACtag. <h:br/><h:br/>
                <h:i><h:b>Function Test</h:b></h:i>
                <h:br/><h:br/> The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement
                the key agreement schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall
                generate or obtain test vectors from a known good implementation of the TOE
                supported schemes. For each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role
                combination, KDF type, and, if supported, key confirmation role- key confirmation
                type combination, the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. The data set
                consists of one set of domain parameter values (FFC) or the NIST approved curve
                (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending
                on the scheme being tested. <h:br/><h:br/> The evaluator shall obtain the DKM,
                the corresponding TOE’s public keys (static and/or ephemeral), the MAC tag(s), and
                any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other Information field OI and TOE id
                fields. <h:br/><h:br/> If the TOE does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A
                Revision 3, the evaluator shall obtain only the public keys and the hashed value of
                the shared secret. <h:br/><h:br/> The evaluator shall verify the correctness of
                the TSF’s implementation of a given scheme by using a known good implementation to
                calculate the shared secret value, derive the keying material DKM, and compare
                hashes or MAC tags generated from these values.<h:br/><h:br/> If key
                confirmation is supported, the TSF shall perform the above for each implemented
                approved MAC algorithm. <h:br/><h:br/>
                <h:i><h:b>Validity Test</h:b></h:i>
                <h:br/><h:br/> The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize
                another party’s valid and invalid key agreement results with or without key
                confirmation. To conduct this test, the evaluator shall obtain a list of the
                supporting cryptographic functions included in the SP800-56A Revision 3 key
                agreement implementation to determine which errors the TOE should be able to
                recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24 (FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors
                consisting of data sets including domain parameter values or NIST approved curves,
                the evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s public/private key pairs, MACTag, and any
                inputs used in the KDF, such as the other info and TOE id fields. <h:br/><h:br/>
                The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE
                recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being
                incorrect: the shared secret value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the
                data to be MACed, or the generated MACTag. If the TOE contains the full or partial
                (only ECC) public key validation, the evaluator will also individually inject errors
                in both parties’ static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public keys and the
                TOE’s static private key to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key
                validation function and/or the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At
                least two of the test vectors shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in
                valid key agreement results (they should pass). <h:br/><h:br/> The TOE shall use
                these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme using the
                corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results with the
                results using a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects these
                errors. <h:br/><h:br/>
                <h:h3>SP800-56B Key Establishment Schemes</h:h3> The evaluator shall verify that
                the TSS describes whether the TOE acts as a sender, a recipient, or both for
                RSA-based key establishment schemes. <h:br/><h:br/> If the TOE acts as a sender,
                the following assurance activity shall be performed to ensure the proper operation
                of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based key establishment scheme: <h:br/>
                To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a
                known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
                supported key establishment scheme and its options (with or without key confirmation
                if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key confirmation
                is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if KTS-OAEP is
                supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test vector
                shall include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any additional
                input parameters if applicable, the MacKey and MacTag if key confirmation is
                incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the evaluator
                shall perform a key establishment encryption operation on the TOE with the same
                inputs (in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, the test shall use the
                MacKey from the test vector instead of the randomly generated MacKey used in normal
                operation) and ensure that the outputted ciphertext is equivalent to the ciphertext
                in the test vector. <h:br/><h:br/> If the TOE acts as a receiver, the following
                assurance activities shall be performed to ensure the proper operation of every TOE
                supported combination of RSA-based key establishment scheme: <h:br/> To conduct
                this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors FCS_CKM.2.1/LOCKED from a
                known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
                supported key establishment scheme and its options (with our without key
                confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key
                confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if
                KTS-OAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test
                vector shall include the RSA private key, the plaintext keying material (KeyData),
                any additional input parameters if applicable, the MacTag in cases where key
                confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector,
                the evaluator shall perform the key establishment decryption operation on the TOE
                and ensure that the outputted plaintext keying material (KeyData) is equivalent to
                the plaintext keying material in the test vector. In cases where key confirmation is
                incorporated, the evaluator shall perform the key confirmation steps and ensure that
                the outputted MacTag is equivalent to the MacTag in the test vector.
                <h:br/><h:br/> The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the TOE
                handles decryption errors. In accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-56B, the
                TOE must not reveal the particular error that occurred, either through the contents
                of any outputted or logged error message or through timing variations. If KTS-OAEP
                is supported, the evaluator shall create separate contrived ciphertext values that
                trigger each of the three decryption error checks described in NIST Special
                Publication 800-56B section 7.2.2.3, ensure that each decryption attempt results in
                an error, and ensure that any outputted or logged error message is identical for
                each. If KTS-KEMKWS is supported, the evaluator shall create separate contrived
                ciphertext values that trigger each of the three decryption error checks described
                in NIST Special Publication 800-56B section 7.2.3.3, ensure that each decryption
                attempt results in an error, and ensure that any outputted or logged error message
                is identical for each.<h:br/><h:br/>
                <h:h3>RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 Key Establishment Schemes</h:h3> The evaluator shall
                verify the correctness of the TSF's implementation of RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 by using a
                known good implementation for each protocol selected in FTP_ITC_EXT.1 that uses
                RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5. <h:h3>Diffie-Hellman Group 14</h:h3> The evaluator shall

                verify that a TOE has implemented the components of the key agreement scheme
                according to the specification. These components include the calculation of the

                <h:b>Function Test</h:b><h:br/><h:br/> The Function test verifies the
                ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement schemes correctly. To conduct this
                test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known good

              the selection appropriate for the device. A DEK is used in addition to the KEK so that

                    in the key expansion step.</h:li>
                  <h:li>The description must include the lengths of the salt values being used in
                    the randomness extraction step and the evaluator shall verify the TSS

              <h:br/><h:br/> Because plaintext key material is not allowed to be written to

            <title>The TSF shall destroy all plaintext keying material and critical security
              parameters when no longer needed. </title>
            <note role="application"> For the purposes of this requirement, plaintext keying
              material refers to authentication data, passwords, secret/private symmetric keys,
              private asymmetric keys, data used to derive keys, values derived from passwords, etc.
              If a BAF is selected in FIA_UAU.5.1 the enrollment or authentication templates are not
              subject to this requirement, since templates are not suitable for deriving keying
              material. However, source biometric data (i.e. fingerprint image or friction ridge
              pattern), the features an algorithm uses to perform biometric authentication for
              enrollment or verification (e.g. location of minutia), threshold values used in making
              the match adjudication, intermediate values calculated while building an enrollment or
              authentication template (i.e. direction maps, minutia counts, binarized and
              skeletonized representations of friction ridge patterns, etc.), and final match scores
              are examples of critical security parameters that must be destroyed when no longer
              needed. <h:br/><h:br/> Key destruction procedures are performed in accordance with
              FCS_CKM_EXT.4.1. <h:br/><h:br/> There are multiple situations in which plaintext
              keying material is no longer necessary, including when the TOE is powered off, when
              the wipe function is performed, when trusted channels are disconnected, when keying
              material is no longer needed by the trusted channel per the protocol, and when
              transitioning to the locked state (for those values derived from the Password
              Authentication Factor or that key material which is protected by the password-derived
              or biometric-unlocked KEK according to FCS_STG_EXT.2 – see <figref ref-id="Keys"/>).
              For keys (or key material used to derive those keys) protecting sensitive data
              received in the locked state, "no longer needed" includes "while in the locked state."
              <h:br/><h:br/> Trusted channels may include TLS, HTTPS, DTLS, IPsec VPNs,
              Bluetooth BR/EDR, and Bluetooth LE. The plaintext keying material for these channels
              includes (but is not limited to) master secrets, and Security Associations (SAs).
              <h:br/><h:br/> If REK(s) are processed in a separate execution environment on the
              same Application Processor as the Rich OS, REK key material must be cleared from RAM
              immediately after use, and at least, must be wiped when the device is locked, as the

                following tests. <h:br/><h:br/> For these tests the evaluator shall utilize
                appropriate development environment (e.g. a Virtual Machine) and development tools
                (debuggers, simulators, etc.) to test that keys are cleared, including all copies of
                the key that may have been created internally by the TOE during normal cryptographic
                processing with that key. <h:br/><h:br/>

                    subsequently encrypted for storage in volatile or non-volatile memory). In the
                    case where the only selection made for the destruction method key was removal of
                    power, then this test is unnecessary. The evaluator shall: <h:br/>

                      <h:li>Record the value of the key in the TOE subject to clearing.</h:li>
                      <h:li>Cause the TOE to perform a normal cryptographic processing with the

                    <h:br/> Steps 1-6 ensure that the complete key does not exist anywhere in

                    Step 7 ensures that partial key fragments do not remain in memory. If a fragment
                    is found, there is a minuscule chance that it is not within the context of a key
                    (e.g., some random bits that happen to match). If this is the case the test
                    should be repeated with a different key in Step #1. If a fragment is found the

            <note role="application">Per NIST SP 800-131A, SHA-1 for generating digital signatures
              is no longer allowed, and SHA-1 for verification of digital signatures is strongly
              discouraged as there may be risk in accepting these signatures. It is expected that
              vendors will implement SHA-2 algorithms in accordance with SP
              800-131A.<h:br/><h:br/> SHA-1 is currently required in order to comply with the
              WLAN Client Extended Package. Vendors are strongly encouraged to implement updated
              protocols that support the SHA-2 family; until updated protocols are supported, this
              PP allows support for SHA-1 implementations in compliance with SP
              800-131A.<h:br/><h:br/> The intent of this requirement is to specify the hashing
              function. The hash selection must support the message digest size selection. The hash
              selection should be consistent with the overall strength of the algorithm used (for
              example, SHA 256 for 128-bit keys). <h:br/><h:br/> The TSF hashing functions can
              be implemented in one of two modes. The first mode is the byte­oriented mode. In this
              mode the TSF only hashes messages that are an integral number of bytes in length; i.e.
              the length (in bits) of the message to be hashed is divisible by 8. The second mode is
              the bit­oriented mode. In this mode the TSF hashes messages of arbitrary length. The
              TSF may implement either bit-oriented or byte-oriented; both implementations are not
              required. </note>
            <aactivity>
              <TSS> The evaluator shall check that the association of the hash function with other
                TSF cryptographic functions (for example, the digital signature verification
                function) is documented in the TSS. The evalutator shall check that the TSS
                indicates if the hashing function is implemented in bit-oriented and/or
                byte-oriented mode. <h:br/><h:br/>
              </TSS>
              <Guidance> The evaluator checks the AGD documents to determine that any configuration
                that is required to be done to configure the functionality for the required hash
                sizes is present.<h:br/><h:br/>

                and used to satisfy the requirements of this PP. As there are different tests for
                each mode, an indication is given in the following sections for the bit­oriented vs.

            <note role="application">SP 800-90A contains three different methods of generating
              random numbers; each of these, in turn, depends on underlying cryptographic primitives
              (hash functions/ciphers). The ST author will select the function used, and include the
              specific underlying cryptographic primitives used in the requirement or in the TSS.
              While any of the identified hash functions (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512) are
              allowed for Hash_DRBG or HMAC_DRBG, only AES-based implementations for CTR_DRBG are
              allowed. <h:br/><h:br/> The ST author must also ensure that any underlying
              functions are included in the baseline requirements for the TOE. <h:br/><h:br/>
              Health testing of the DRBGs is performed in conjunction with the self-tests required
              in FPT_TST_EXT.1.1. <h:br/><h:br/> For the selection in FCS_RBG_EXT.1.2, the ST
              author selects the appropriate number of bits of entropy that corresponds to the
              greatest security strength of the algorithms included in the ST. Security strength is
              defined in Tables 2 and 3 of NIST SP 800-57A. For example, if the implementation
              includes 2048-bit RSA (security strength of 112 bits), AES 128 (security strength 128
              bits), and HMAC-SHA-256 (security strength 256 bits), then the ST author would select
              256 bits. <h:br/><h:br/> The ST author may select either software or hardware
              noise sources. A hardware noise source is a component that produces data that cannot
              be explained by a deterministic rule, due to its physical nature. In other words, a
              hardware based noise source generates sequences of random numbers from a physical
              process that cannot be predicted. For example, a sampled ring oscillator consists of
              an odd number of inverter gates chained into a loop, with an electrical pulse
              traveling from inverter to inverter around the loop. The inverters are not clocked, so
              the precise time required for a complete circuit around the loop varies slightly as
              various physical effects modify the small delay time at each inverter on the line to
              the next inverter. This variance results in an approximate natural frequency that
              contains drift and jitter over time. The output of the ring oscillator consists of the
              oscillating binary value sampled at a constant rate from one of the inverters – a rate
              that is significantly slower than the oscillator’s natural frequency. </note>

                appropriate instructions for configuring the RNG functionality.<h:br/><h:br/>
              </Guidance>
              <Tests>
                <h:b>Evaluation Activity Note:</h:b> The following tests require the developer to
                provide access to a test platform that provides the evaluator with tools that are
                typically not found on factory products. <h:br/><h:br/> The evaluator shall
                perform 15 trials for the RNG implementation. If the RNG is configurable, the
                evaluator shall perform 15 trials for each configuration. <h:br/><h:br/> If the
                RNG has prediction resistance enabled, each trial consists of (1) instantiate DRBG,
                (2) generate the first block of random bits (3) generate a second block of random
                bits (4) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the second block of random bits
                is the expected value. The evaluator shall generate eight input values for each
                trial. The first is a count (0 – 14). The next three are entropy input, nonce, and
                personalization string for the instantiate operation. The next two are additional
                input and entropy input for the first call to generate. The final two are additional
                input and entropy input for the second call to generate. These values are randomly
                generated. "generate one block of random bits" means to generate random bits with
                number of returned bits equal to the Output Block Length (as defined in NIST
                SP800-90A). <h:br/><h:br/> If the RNG does not have prediction resistance, each
                trial consists of (1) instantiate DRBG, (2) generate the first block of random bits
                (3) reseed, (4) generate a second block of random bits (5) uninstantiate. The
                evaluator verifies that the second block of random bits is the expected value. The
                evaluator shall generate eight input values for each trial. The first is a count (0
                – 14). The next three are entropy input, nonce, and personalization string for the
                instantiate operation. The fifth value is additional input to the first call to
                generate. The sixth and seventh are additional input and entropy input to the call
                to reseed. The final value is additional input to the second generate call.
                <h:br/><h:br/> The following paragraphs contain more information on some of the
                input values to be generated/selected by the evaluator. <h:br/><h:br/>

                  <h:li><h:b>Entropy input: </h:b>the length of the entropy input value must
                    equal the seed length.</h:li>
                  <h:li><h:b>Nonce: </h:b>If a nonce is supported (CTR_DRBG with no Derivation
                    Function does not use a nonce), the nonce bit length is one-half the seed
                    length.</h:li>
                  <h:li><h:b>Personalization string: </h:b>The length of the personalization
                    string must be &#2264; seed length. If the implementation only supports one
                    personalization string length, then the same length can be used for both values.
                    If more than one string length is support, the evaluator shall use
                    personalization strings of two different lengths. If the implementation does not
                    use a personalization string, no value needs to be supplied.</h:li>
                  <h:li><h:b>Additional input: </h:b>the additional input bit lengths have the
                    same defaults and restrictions as the personalization string lengths.</h:li>

  <appendix title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment" id="entropyappendix"> This appendix
    describes the required supplementary information for the entropy source used by the OS. <h:br/>
    The documentation of the entropy source should be detailed enough that, after reading, the
    evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why it can be relied upon to provide
    sufficient entropy. This documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design
    description, entropy justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation
    is not required to be part of the TSS. <section id="entropydesign" title="Design Description">
      Documentation shall include the design of the entropy source as a whole, including the
      interaction of all entropy source components. Any information that can be shared regarding the
      design should also be included for any third-party entropy sources that are included in the
      product. <h:br/> The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to include,
      how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the
      entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source
      design indicating where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any
      post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how
      it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking)
      should also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.
      <h:br/> This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of
      the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary
      outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate. <h:br/> If implemented, the design
      description shall include a description of how third-party applications can add entropy to the
      RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on shall be included. </section>
    <section id="entropyjustification" title="Entropy Justification"> There should be a technical
      argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence
      in the entropy source delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output (by
      this particular OS). This argument will include a description of the expected min-entropy
      rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per bit or byte of source data) and explain that
      sufficient entropy is going into the OS randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be
      part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to produce bits with
      entropy. <h:br/> The amount of information necessary to justify the expected min-entropy rate
      depends on the type of entropy source included in the product. <h:br/> For developer provided
      entropy sources, in order to justify the min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number
      of raw source bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the min-entropy
      rate determined from the statistical tests. While no particular statistical tests are required
      at this time, it is expected that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount
      of min-entropy in each output. <h:br/> For third-party provided entropy sources, in which the
      OS vendor has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the
      documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy obtained from this
      third-party source. It is acceptable for the vendor to “assume” an amount of min-entropy,
      however, this assumption must be clearly stated in the documentation provided. In particular,
      the min-entropy estimate must be specified and the assumption included in the ST. <h:br/>
      Regardless of type of entropy source, the justification will also include how the DRBG is
      initialized with the entropy stated in the ST, for example by verifying that the min-entropy
      rate is multiplied by the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the rate of
      entropy expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and compared to the
      statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG is not clear or the
      calculated rate is not explicitly related to the seed, the documentation will not be
      considered complete. <h:br/> The entropy justification shall not include any data added from any
      third-party application or from any state saving between restarts. </section>
    <section id="entropyoperatingconditions" title="Operating Conditions"> The entropy rate may be
      affected by conditions outside the control of the entropy source itself. For example, voltage,
      frequency, temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the factors that may
      affect the operation of the entropy source. As such, documentation will also include the range
      of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. It
      will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the system design to ensure the
      entropy source continues to operate under those conditions. Similarly, documentation shall
      describe the conditions under which the entropy source is known to malfunction or become
      inconsistent. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of the source shall be included. </section>
    <section id="entropyhealthtesting" title="Health Testing"> More specifically, all entropy source
      health tests and their rationale will be documented. This includes a description of the health
      tests, the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at start,
      continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, and rationale
      indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in
      the entropy source. </section>
